You are a DevOps engineer at an organization that is moving their configuration to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. The application team has developed a module to deploy their application and wants to set up multiple instances of the app so they can quickly test new features in an environment that mirrors their main infrastructure, without actually testing in production. While the infrastructure needs to mirror the main deployment as closely as possible, the solution will need flexibility for differences between the environments. You can use workspaces to design a solution that meets these needs.
