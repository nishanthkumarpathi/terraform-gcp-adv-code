You are a DevOps engineer at an organization that is migrating all their configuration management to Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

The organization is preparing for an upcoming audit, and the security team has created lists of permissions the auditors should have. 

Since these permission sets do not map to any existing roles, you will need to create custom roles. 

You will need to create these roles using Terraform and leverage as much automation as possible to prevent potential copy and paste errors. 

Using Terraform's filesystem functions, you will create Terraform code to convert the text files from the security team into custom GCP roles.
